Intuitively, this results in a total number of comparisons represented by the sum of i*(i-1) from i = 1 to n which is a quadratic function. Each of these comparisons represents a calculation of the pairwise alignment of two fragments which can be done in linear time with respect to k. Merging two fragments can also be done in linear time with respect to k. As a result the total complexity can be described by n*[k*(sum from i = 1 to n of i*(i-1)) + k] which is in the complexity class Theta(n^3*k + n*k). This can be reduced to Theta(n^3*k)."

This algorithm would not be guaranteed to produce the correct solution if choosing a locally optimal pair to merge could prevent optimal merges in the future. With that being said, the amount of overlap between fragments will always be the same regardless of whether or not they have been merged with other fragments since the merges used here maintain the order and integrity of all fragments and simply remove redundant information at each step. After merging two fragments, it is impossible for the merged fragment to have smaller overlap with a third fragment than that fragment would have had with either of the original two fragments. As a result, we are not jeopardizing any future optimal merges by making the locally optimal decision and can conclude that this algorithm will always find the correct genome. "
